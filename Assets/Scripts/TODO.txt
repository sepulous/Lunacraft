* Save mobs when saving chunks


Let's try to remove the need for border chunks.
    1. Each chunk stores a border that includes blocks from adjacent chunks
    2. Every block place/destroy affects 2 or 4 chunks




IDEA: Run-length encode the chunk columns. The algorithm is very simple and extremely compatible with the structure.
    - Then, I don't have to do 128 iterations when spawning blocks. I can skip the air entirely (unless it's interrupted by trees/crystal plants).

    Possible issue: I may not be able to compress on-the-fly, which requires a large iteration to compress

typical case (roughly):
    rock ~ 60 bytes -> 2 bytes
    gravel ~ 4 bytes
    dirt ~ 4 bytes
    air ~ 70 bytes -> 2 bytes

Uncompressed: ~131 kB
Compressed: ~12 kB
Ratio: 10.67
